# Slam-bot

This page details a SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) robot that was built as a final project for ECE 4180 at Georgia Tech. To view source code for this project, please click the blue "view on GitHub" button in the upper-right corner of this webpage.

## Project Idea

The intention of this project was to create a simple, cheap, and easily reproducible SLAM robot. This was accomplished using only parts found in the 4180 Mbed kits, which are easily found on Sparkfun. The robot uses a lidar sensor mounted on a cheap brushed DC motor to sense its surroundings, and performs position estimation using an IMU and dead reckoning. Two more brushed DC motors are used for navigation.
